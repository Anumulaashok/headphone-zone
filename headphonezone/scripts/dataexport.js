Step into a new world of music, full of rich detail, low-end clarity and overall accuracy.\n\nENJOY EXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION\n\nThe LCD-3 uses Fazors, special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure. They enhance transparency by affecting the sound waves generated by large planar diaphragms. A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nEXPERIENCE AUDEZE'S PROPRIETARY PLANAR MAGNETIC DRIVERS\n\nRather than use standard headphone drivers that operate like miniature woofers or tweeters, the LCD-3 uses a large, 6.17-square-inch thin-film planar magnetic driver that's embedded with Audeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm that's thinner than a human hair for fast response times. This gives a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nHANDCRAFTED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS\n\nMade in the USA, the Audeze LCD-3 are handcrafted using high-quality luxurious materials. It features Audeze's tonal balance and powerful bass that beautifully articulates the power and nuance of your favourite music. The gorgeous wooden rings are designed for the audiophile with a discerning ear & style. The real lambskin leather or Microsuede earpads and headband use acoustical foam for the best fit and sound.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n15W (for 200ms)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n110 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz – 20kHz extended out to 50kHz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm to 1/4in stereo adaptor\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n2.5m 1/4in to dual 4-pin mini-XLR cable, 2.5m 4-pin XLR to dual 4-pin, Mini-XLR cable\n\nWEIGHT\n543g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

  "description": "Designed in the USA\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nBest Suited for Portable Use\n\nESS ES9038Q2M DAC Chip\n\n2.1 Volts Power Output\n\nPair with Laptop via USB\n\nSuper Lightweight Design\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE ULTIMATE PORTABLE AMP/DAC\n\nThe AudioQuest DragonFly Cobalt has been developed in partnership with Gordon Rankin and Microchip Technologies. It has a better signal to noise ratio and a much lower power consumption than the original DragonFly. It consists of Gordon's monoClock® (single ultra-low-jitter clock). Thanks to the new Microchip PIC32MX274 microcontroller, the processing speed increases by 33%. This makes it perfect to play music at all kinds of resolution (including MQA) and from any music streaming app of your choice.\n\nESS ES9038Q2M DAC CHIP & 9601 AMP FOR POWERFUL SOUND WITH LESSER NOISE\n\nThe DragonFly Cobalt has an output of 2.1 volts—enough power to successfully drive all preamplifier input circuits and a wide range of today’s efficient headphones. Its improved power supply filtering specifically reduces the noise of WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular signals. It comes with a 32-bit ESS ES9038Q2M DAC chip that employs minimum-phase slow roll-off filtering for naturally detailed, more authentic sound. The ESS Sabre 9601 headphone amp and bit-perfect digital volume control add that much-needed power. You can use the source device's volume controls to adjust the DragonFly Cobalt's volume.\n\nWORKS BEST WITH ANY DEVICE OF YOUR CHOICE\n\nThe DragonFly Cobalt's software can be easily upgraded thanks to the Desktop Device Manager. It includes a form-fitting DragonTail USB-A to USB-C Adaptor. All DragonTails use AQ's Carbon-level USB cable. Streamlength™ asynchronous USB code ensures low jitter, low resource load, minimal packet errors, world-class audio playback, and reliable connectivity between the DAC and any computing device with a USB input. It requires no additional drivers, making the DragonFly Cobalt virtually plug-and-play for Apple, Windows, iOS and Android users.\n\nSUPPORTS MQA FOR MASTER-QUALITY SOUND\n\nThe Dragonfly Cobalt supports Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) playback. This is an award-winning audio technology that's meant to deliver the sound of the original master recording. MQA files are tiny and can easily be streamed using Tidal.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nSTATUS/SAMPLE RATES SUPPORTED (LED INDICATOR COLOR CODE)\nStandby (Red), 44.1kHz (Green), 48kHz (Blue), 88.2kHz (Yellow), 96kHz (Light Blue), MQA (Purple)\n\nVOLUME CONTROL\n64-position, 64-bit, bit-perfect\n\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE\n2.1\n\nHEADPHONE AMP\nESS Sabre 9601\n\nDAC CHIP\nESS ES9038Q2M with minimum-phase slow roll-off filter for more natural sound\n\nMICROCONTROLLER\nMicrochip PIC32MX274 reduces current draw and increases processing speed by 33% over DragonFlys Black and Red\n\nDIMENSIONS\n12mm H x 19mm W by 57mm L\n\nSUPPORTED INPUTS\n3.5mm Stereo Jack\n\nWEIGHT\n22g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Flight Manual\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat are the main differences between DragonFlys Black, Red, and Cobalt?\n\nAll DragonFlys are designed to preserve the body, warmth, and natural beauty in music. We like to think of the progression like this: Black is beautiful, Red is more beautiful, and Cobalt is most beautiful. For a complete Model Comparison Chart, Click here.\n\nWill DragonFly make my internal computer speakers sound better?\n\nNo. DragonFly does not use the internal speakers in your computer. DragonFly is specifically designed to connect to external audio devices, such as headphones, powered desktop speakers, complete audio/video systems, and iOS and Android mobile devices. Note: DragonFly v1.0 and DragonFly v1.2 are designed to work with computers and laptops only; they are not designed for use with iOS and Android mobile devices. However, all current-production DragonFly models—Black, Red, and Cobalt—are compatible with iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat kind of audio content can I play through DragonFly?\n\nFrom MP3 to MQA and Hi-Res, DragonFly adds life, meaning, and color to all of your music. With all current-production models of AudioQuest’s DragonFly USB DAC (Black, Red, Cobalt), music appreciation and exploration are limitless: Plug into an Apple or Windows® computer or connect to an iOS® or Android mobile device. Play YouTube or Vimeo videos. Go hunting on Bandcamp or SoundCloud. Explore playlists and podcasts on Spotify, Pandora, or Deezer. Stream high-res audio from Tidal or Qobuz. No matter the choice of sonic pleasure, DragonFly unravels the emotional expression and nuance that makes music and movies so enjoyable.\n\nWhat headphones can I use with the DragonFly?\n\nDragonFly is versatile enough to drive virtually any headphone on the market today, from impedances of 10ohm and higher. While all DragonFly models offer enough output to drive most headphones, DragonFly Black (1.2-volt output) comfortably drives most medium- to moderate-efficiency models and DragonFlys Red and Cobalt (2.1-volt output) easily drive even the lowest-efficiency models.\n\nWhat is an MQA Renderer?\n\nand also matches and compensates the DAC characteristics to the hierarchical target, matching the analog sound heard in the studio. All current-production AudioQuest DragonFlys (Black, Red, and Cobalt) feature an MQA renderer that enables playback of MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the original master recording. When connected to an MQA Core signal (within TIDAL Masters or Audirvana, for example), DragonFly’s purple display indicates the unit is rendering an MQA stream or file.\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Apple device?\n\nAs a fully functional MQA renderer, your DragonFly is ready to unfold and play MQA files through the Tidal music-streaming service. If you have a Tidal Master account and want to enjoy the full benefits of Tidal Master (MQA) files through DragonFly, simply adjust your Tidal playback settings: macOS\nClick on your profile name (located in the top left corner of the Tidal desktop application)\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nUnder “Streaming Audio Quality,” select “Master”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nMake sure that “Passthrough MQA” is not selected\niOS, iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro\nClick “My Collection” (the heart icon; located in the bottom right of the mobile app)\nClick the gear wheel (located in the upper right)\nScroll down and click “Streaming”\nSet WiFi to “Master”\nSet Cellular to your desired option, noting that streaming hi-res with MQA will require a relatively large amount of data\nMake sure “Optimized playback” is enabled\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Windows computer?\n\nTo play MQA files from Tidal on a Windows computer, follow these steps in the Tidal app:\nClick on your profile name\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Android device?\n\nFor Android playback, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro media player by eXtream Software Development.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Windows operating systems?\n\nYes. DragonFly is compatible with Windows 7 and later. If you’re running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, please be sure to install the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (August 9, 2016), to maintain optimal USB audio performance.\n\nWhy can’t I select 88.2kHz as the sample rate in Windows 7?\n\nMicrosoft does not offer native support for 88.2kHz with its Windows 7 operating system. Fortunately, aftermarket programs such as JRiver Media Center and Foobar2000 bypass the Windows “Hardware and Sound” application and allow native 88.2kHz decoding. For more information please visit www.jriver.com or www.foobar2000.org.\n\nAre there known USB-Audio issues with Windows 8 and Windows RT?\n\nEarly versions of Windows 8 had compatibility issues with their device drivers and many USB DACs (including DragonFly). If you are running Windows 8, we suggest that you do the following:\nMake sure your OS has all of the latest updates and service packs installed.\nOnce all OS updates have been installed, check that all hardware device drivers are up to date and compatible with the latest version of Windows 8.\n\nThere are no reported audio issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nThe AQ Device Manager is not detecting my DragonFly. What should I do?\n\nIf the installation is complete and the DragonFly is not visible, you may need to restart your computer to complete the installation process.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Mac OS X?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt are compatible with OS X (starting with OS 10.6.8 to present). There are no known compatibility issues with OS X.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Apple iOS devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black and Red can be used with Apple iOS devices. Yes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt can be used with Apple iOS devices. An Apple Camera Adapter is required to connect DragonFly to an Apple Lightning device. In our tests, Apple's Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter (with charging port) sounds better and is more reliable than Apple’s less expensive Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, while also providing the ability to charge during playback. Your mileage may vary. Some users prefer the size of the smaller adapter, while others prefer the performance of the larger adapter. We encourage experimentation. When DragonFly (Black, Red, Cobalt) is connected to an iOS device using Apple’s older Lightning to USB Camera Connection Kit, I can hear clicks and pops in the background of the music. What should I do? In some rare instances, the combination of an iOS device in conjunction with the standard CCK and DragonFly Black, Red, or Cobalt causes a clicking in the background of the music. Neither we nor Apple have been able to determine why this is, but, in circumstances where this occurs, we’ve found that using Apple’s Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter resolves the problem. In addition, this connector offers improved audio performance over the smaller unit and provides the ability to charge the attached iOS device while listening to music.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Android devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt will work with most Android devices running on Lollipop OS (and some Android devices running on KitKat), provided that the device manufacturer has adhered to the USB specification and implementation, and supports audio over USB. To verify that your Android device complies with isochronous USB audio, download and run USB Host Check. In our early pre-production testing, we found that some Android devices (4.1 OS and newer) do not provide native support for audio over USB. If you find that your Android device (4.1 or newer) does not support audio over USB, we ask that you please contact the manufacturer of your device. To determine whether your device supports audio over USB, consult the user manual or visit the manufacturer’s website. Despite Android’s support of USB audio output, there are still hardware manufacturers that do not completely adhere to the USB audio class specification. If you experience this, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro application. UAPP includes its own USB audio device driver that is compliant with the USB Organization’s USB Audio Host Mode Class specification. Further, it is compatible with various audio formats and will manage music on both the Android’s internal memory and inserted SD cards. With the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network, this application can also find and connect to DLNA servers/libraries. USB Audio Player PRO Version 5 now supports audio from Google Music, Tidal (including Tidal Masters), Qobuz, and Shoutcast, and includes an MQA Core Decoder, which will unfold MQA streams from 44.1/48kHz to 88.2/96 kHz and can be combined with DragonFly for further unfolding of even higher sample rates.\n\nHow do I set volume level when using DragonFly?\n\nWhen using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, start at a low (or zero) volume level, then slowly raise the volume until the desired level is achieved. When using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, it functions in variable output mode, and we recommend the following steps:\nSet the volume control of the associated music player application to maximum.\nSet the computer’s main (operating system) volume control to 25% of maximum.\nUsing the computer’s main (operating system) volume control, adjust the volume to the desired level.\n\nDragonFly Black is equipped with a 64-step analog volume control. With DragonFly Black connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly Black’s onboard volume. This ensures maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nIn DragonFly Red and Cobalt, we were able to employ a highly sophisticated 64-step, 64-bit, bit-perfect digital volume control. It works similarly: With DragonFly Red/Cobalt connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly’s onboard volume. Here again, we’ve optimized the volume control to ensure maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nYou can also use DragonFly as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD player, DVD player, or Blu-ray player), connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. When used in this manner, DragonFly functions in fixed output mode, which allows the overall volume level to be adjusted with the audio/video system’s master volume control. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the computer’s main (operating system) volume level should be set to maximum.\n\nDragonFly can play audio data at four different sample rates. Which one should I choose?\n\nDragonFly will play music or audio data at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. For the best sound quality, the computer should be configured so that it sends music and audio data to DragonFly that matches the native rate of the music. For example, since all CDs use a sample rate of 44.1kHz, 44.1kHz tends to be the “native rate” of most digital music. In most cases, for most people, this will be the best sample rate to choose. Choosing a sample rate that is higher than the native rate of a music file will convert the audio data using mathematical approximations that can potentially decrease the sound quality. Conversely, if you have high-resolution music files, configuring your computer for 44.1kHz (or any other lower sample rate) will cause the computer to down-sample your music to a lower resolution. When possible, always configure the computer to output the native sample rate of the music you are listening to. Many music player software suites on the market manage this process for you.\n\nWhat do the various colors of DragonFly’s LED indicate?\n\nDragonFly’s LED displays different colors to indicate status or sample rate of audio data. For DragonFlys Black and Red: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Amber = 88.2kHz; Magenta = 96kHz; Purple = MQA. For DragonFly Cobalt: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Yellow = 88.2kHz; Light Blue = 96kHz; Purple = MQA.\n\nI purchased high-resolution music files at 24-bit/176.4kHz or 24-bit/192kHz. Can I play these files using my DragonFly? Yes. However, as mentioned above, DragonFly performs best when audio data is processed at its native sample rate.\n\nIf you have higher resolution files, it is important to choose the correct higher sample rate in order to maximize the benefit of those files. For the best performance with sampling rates above DragonFly’s 96kHz ceiling, files should be played at a rate mathematically related to their native resolution. For instance, a 192kHz file should be played at 96kHz (i.e., 2 x 96000.0 = 192000.0). By selecting sample rates that are directly divisible, the computer avoids having to do sonically degrading, complex math in its conversions, and allows DragonFly to sound its best.\n\nWhat music player applications does AudioQuest recommend?\n\nWhile iTunes was once the easy and obvious answer, a cottage industry of higher-performance, add-on applications have since sprouted up. These applications address OS X only.\nAmarra\nAudirvana Plus\nBit Perfect\nPure Music\n\nStand-alone media players (for Apple and Windows)\n\nJRiver is a complete audio and video media player, offering both USB and Network (airplay and DLNA) connectivity.\nRoon works seamlessly with a local media collection and Tidal Streaming services. Additionally, Roon enables streaming to multiple locations, and a complementary iPad application enables an external interface.\nTidal is a subscription-based, CD-quality (1411kbps) streaming service. It offers both music and high-definition video content, including full-length concerts\nQobuz is a subscription-based streaming service that offers an outstanding selection of hi-resolution content.\n\nFor any technical support or questions regarding the functionality or use of these recommended playback applications, please contact the manufacturer. AudioQuest cannot provide technical support for any of these recommended playback applications.\n\nIs DragonFly a FCC-compliant digital device?\n\nDragonFly has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy, and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\nReorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\nIncrease the separation between the equipment and receiver.\nConnect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that of the receiver.\nConsult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician.\n\nModifications not expressly approved by the manufacturer could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment under FCC rules.\n\nIs it better to leave DragonFly constantly plugged in, or should I unplug it when it’s not in use?\n\nIt is completely safe to leave DragonFly plugged in at all times. We hope that you will always want it connected to your music playback device! While repeatedly plugging and unplugging DragonFly will not affect its lifespan or reliability, in general we have found that DACs measure and sound better after being left on for at least 24 hours.\n\nDo you recommend using JitterBug with DragonFly?\n\nWe absolutely recommend using JitterBug with DragonFlys Black and Red, both in series (with DragonFly plugged directly into JitterBug) and/or in parallel (with JitterBug plugged into a separate USB port within the host computer). However, because some of JitterBug’s filtering is included in DragonFly Cobalt, a JitterBug is not necessary and not recommended with mobile devices or when only one USB port is available. When using Cobalt, you can still optimize the digital audio from a computer, car stereo, or other hardware by adding a JitterBug (in parallel only) into a different USB port.\n\nDOWNLOADS\nFlight Manual DragonFly Cobalt\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this AudioQuest DragonFly Cobalt comes with a 1 year warranty from AudioQuest that covers manufacturing defects.

It’s small, pretty, sounds great, is affordable and does full MQA.\"\nRead More\n\n\"If you've already invested in decent wired headphones or IEMs and don't want to go wireless, the AudioQuest - DragonFly Cobalt is well worth considering!\"\nRead More\n\n“Overall, the differences between the two AudioQuest DACs were relatively small, but I preferred the Cobalt for long-term listening.”\nRead More\n\n\"Also new to the Cobalt table is “improved power supply filtering” that specifically targets WiFi, Bluetooth and cellular noise. That’s electrical noise (not acoustic).\"\nRead More\n\n\" Its sound was obviously more open, quiet, devoid of any slightly grainy or \"fizzy\" tinge, and effortlessly dynamic. And the bass was just all-around better: deeper, tighter, more everything.\"\nRead More",

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The ZS10 Pro more than delivers with it.\n\nPRAVEEN KAMATH\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout PRAVEEN KAMATH\nPraveen, our Headphone Zone is an audio connoisseur and staunch Meze fanboy. He loves the RAI Penta and the Empyrean, equally. When not writing about, thinking about or listening to music: He's an avid beerologist too and staunchly believes that the combination of both beats every music setup out there! You'll often find him listening to The Weeknd, The Score and The Script.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n4 BALANCED ARMATURES + 1 DYNAMIC DRIVER FOR INCREDIBLE SOUND\n\nAs an upgraded version of the ZS10, the KZ ZS10 Pro uses customised balanced armature drivers, 2 for the high and 2 for the mid frequencies. It also adopts the 2nd generation Tesla double magnetic dynamic unit for the rhythm and bass.\n\nUSES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC COME ALIVE\n\nKZ's independent research and development with dynamic drivers are responsible for the ZS10 Pro's low-frequency output. It is excellently crafted using the PCB electronic frequency division board resulting in smooth and distortion-free sound. The Dual Balanced Armature drivers are responsible for the mid and treble performance. It provides a high-intensity resolution, rich sense of quality and full vocals that makes these IEMs a pure listening experience for you.\n\nDESIGNED TO LOOK GOOD & LAST LONG\n\nThis IEM's faceplate is made of 304 stainless steel while the cavity is made from imported resin. These two different materials add shimmer and an exquisite look to the earphone which also makes them durable and long-lasting. The superior noise isolation cancels out ambient sound.\n\nMADE TO BE FLEXIBLE\n\nThe ZS10 Pro's wire hooks are made of expensive memory metal, which makes it very convenient for users to adjust the earphones around the ear. The cable that comes in the box terminates in a 3.5mm plug and comes with an inline remote & mic. It's easy to change your IEMs from wired to wireless or upgrade the cable with the detachable 2-pin slots. The new limit slot protection design keeps the pins from breaking and ensures a longer life.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\n5 Drivers (4 x BA + 1 x Dynamic)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n24 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n111dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7-40,000Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE LENGHT\n1.2m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

  "description": "Designed & Made in the USA\n\n5 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nConnect With RCA\n\nMetal Build\n\nRemote Controls\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nBE PASSIVE OR ACTIVE: IT'S YOUR CHOICE\n\nThe Schiit Saga+ is a hi-fi preamp that has two modes to choose from. The Active Mode is best used for when you have to drive long cables and want to take advantage of the warm tube sound. This mode uses the 6SN7 based hybrid tube buffer. The result? A mean machine running on 200V for incredibly low levels of distortion. In the Passive Mode, you use it with a remote-controlled passive preamp which is apt for various systems.\n\nCONTROLS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nThe Saga+ is made for those who desire the best for their home audio setup. The custom remote control allows you to control volume, input switching, output switching, and muting. Switch on your music with the stepped attenuator that uses a relay switch so that your volume is clear. If you are using the remote control, the volume setting matches that of the remote.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nHYBRID TUBE BUFFER STAGE\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20Khz, -0.2db, 3Hz-200KHz, -3dB\n\nTHD\n<0.001%, 20Hz-20KHz, at 1V RMS\n\nIMD\n<0.001%, CCIR (active stage)\n\nSNR\n108db, A-weighted, referenced to 1V RMS\n\nMAXIMUM OUTPUT\n10V RMS\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n180 ohms\n\nPASSIVE STAGE\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\nvaries, maximum 4.8 kohms\n\nBOTH PASSIVE OR ACTIVE STAGE\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n10k ohms\n\nGAIN\nApproximately 1 (0dB) through either passive or active stage\n\nCROSSTALK\n-75dB, 20Hz-20KHz\n\nINPUTS\n5 RCA pairs, selectable via front switch or remote\n\nOUTPUTS\n2 RCA pairs, selectable via front switch or remote\n\nBUFFER STAGE\nHybrid push-pull tube-BJT buffer stage with equalized transconductance\n\nVOLUME CONTROL\nrelay-switched stepped attenuator with discrete thin-film resistors , 64 1dB steps\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nOne 24VA transformer with regulated +/-100V rails, plus 6.3VDC heaters and 5VDC for microprocessor\n\nPOWER CONSUMPTION\n25W typical\n\nSIZE\n9\"W x6\"D x 2\"H, plus additional 1.25\" H for tube\n\nWEIGHT\n6 lbs\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit Saga+\n\n2. Power cord\n\n3. 6N8S or 6SN7 tube\n\nFAQs\n\nHow is Saga+ different than the original Saga?\n\nIt’s really just a few things: 1. Saga+ has a motorized pot that tracks the remote control volume, whereas Saga did not; which provides a continuous physical reference for the volume level. 2. Saga+ uses DC heaters for the tube buffer stage, which provides a lower noise floor when in buffer mode. 3. Saga+ uses our new “fastenerless” chassis design for a sleeker overall look.\n\nWhy would I need a preamp?\n\nIf you’re using a power amp without volume control, you’ll need a preamp. The preamp allows you to control volume, switch inputs, etc.\n\nAha. So what’s so special about your Saga?\n\nLots of things. But let’s start where you probably aren’t expecting us to: in the philosophy. Yes, philosophy. Because in the past 20 years or so, audio gear has gone into full gold-plated Bentley/60’ private yacht/$120MM beach estate mode. As in, prices are completely and utterly insane. Go ahead. Look around for a remote passive preamp, and check the prices. Now add a tube stage. Oh, wait, there aren’t any of those, so check out remote controlled tube preamps. Ouch, part 2. And then start looking at preamps that use a sophisticated, perfectly-matched relay-switched stepped attenuator instead of a volume pot or cheap volume-control chip, and we’ll excuse you so you can go scream at the injustice of the world. And then there’s Saga+, at $399.\n\nSo how do you make it so cheap?\n\nBy making a ton of them at a time, by using automated surface-mount assembly, and through smart design that doesn’t need a ton of hand-work to solder and route wiring. And by selling direct. No magic.\n\nSo what’s this about it being passive or active? How does that work?\n\nPassive preamps are great if you have short cable runs and high-impedance inputs to your power amp. On the other hand, active preamps give you the ability to run longer cables and drive low-impedance inputs on some power amps. Saga+ is both. Switch it to passive mode to bypass the tube buffer, or switch it to active mode to use the tube buffer. It’s up to you.\n\nAnd this bizarre hybrid tube buffer? What’s that?\n\nThere are plenty of tube buffers out there, but ours is unique. It’s actually a hybrid push-pull tube buffer, featuring a dual triode tube and a pair of BJTs (bipolar junction transistors), with a unique transconductance-equalizing network that pairs the tube and transistor more seamlessly, and helps cancel distortion. The result is a buffer that measures insanely well—better than some solid-state stages!\n\nI don’t care what it measures like, I care what it sounds like!\n\nYes, and some people care what it measures like, too. In our opinion, it both measures and sounds great. Of course, we’re biased\n\nAnd this relay-stepped attenuator thing?\n\nYeah. It’s cool. Unlike a potentiometer, it gives you perfect channel matching down to the lowest level of the volume knob. And, the knob on the front of the preamp acts just like a normal volume knob—it stops at the bottom and top of its travel. No endlessly spinning encoders here. Just the same easy-to-use knob you’re used to, coupled with sophisticated microprocessor control.\n\nBut I don’t want to deal with tubes!\n\nThen you need Saga S, the solid-state Saga. It also saves you $100.\n\nBut I want just a passive preamp—can’t you make a version like that?\n\nYes, and other people want just a tube buffer, or they want a preamp with gain, or they want a preamp with a DAC input, or they want a preamp with a phono input, or they want a preamp that’s based on a different kind of tube, or they want a preamp that’s based on a different kind of transistor, or they want a preamp without a remote, or they want a preamp with an app for a remote, or they want a preamp with Bluetooth, or a thousand other things. While we hope you like the Saga, and that it fits your needs, we can only build them one way. That’s one of the reasons it doesn’t cost like a good used car.\n\nHey, I want balanced inputs and outputs!\n\nThen you need Freya+, Saga+’s big sister.\n\nSo what’s a Saga?\n\nSaga is a seeress, or a goddess associated with wisdom. Once you get off the beaten path in Norse mythology, it starts getting a bit murky like this. But we do think you’ll find Saga+ a wise choice in a system needing a preamp.\n\nWarranty\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Saga+ comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Schiit's warranty in India.",

  "description": "Designed & Made in Germany\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nFor Studio & Professionals\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nSemi Open-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\n45mm Dynamic Drivers\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSUPERLATIVE AT EVERYTHING: IMPEDANCE, POWER AND SOUND DETAILING\n\nThe robust and dynamic neodymium magnets reproduce the quality sound Beyerdynamic is known for. This increased efficiency also leaves the DT 880 Edition with greater power reserves for precise linear response that is especially suited for high-achieving audio applications where succinct audio reproduction is of paramount importance, and dedicated equipment is available such as a headphone amplifier. The large 250-ohm voice coil provides unparalleled response clarity and increased impulse fidelity. The 250-ohm is the most widely used variant.\n\nSURREAL SOUNDSTAGE EXPERIENCE\n\nSoundstage is that spectrum of music that extends beyond your mind, and creates a sonic illusion of sorts. That is what the DT 880 Edition produces for you, effortlessly. Be it the driver units or the highly intelligible semi-open back design, that is the exact experience the Beyerdynamic DT880 Edition brings home.\n\nINCREASED FIDELITY AND SUPERIOR SONICS\n\nBeyerdynamic comes with the promise of dynamic transducer systems that are placed in their headphones. The over-achieving transducer systems only portray the amount of detailed engineering these headphones can boast of. Increased fidelity and performance is the one obvious feature of these specifically engineered headphones.\n\nSEMI-OPEN BACK DESIGN FORM-FACTOR\n\nThe DT 880 Edition semi-open, over-the-ear design offers slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage, while retaining the high fidelity normally associated with open-back headphones. The semi-open back also lets the headphones breathe which make the sound reproduced seem natural and enhances it to a great extent.\n\nADJUSTABLE HEADBAND, VELOUR EARPADS FOR ADDED COMFORT\n\nMindfully designed, the DT880 Edition comes with an adjustable headband, whose little notch is on the side. Move it to adjust the headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head. The headband created with high-end strap-on leather, will only increase the comfort. The velour earpads are synonymous to bespoke luxury, and speak volumes of the comfort they provide. The build quality of the headphones has also been improved. The single-sided straight cable avoids getting tangled so that your music experience is compromised in no way.\n\nHIGHEST 'HIGHS' IN THE ROOM\n\nOne of the most noticeable features of these headphones is the treble they produce.

Meaning that they are intended to deliver audio that sounds as real as possible.\nRead More\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the warranty period on the Beyerdynamic - DT 880 Edition?\n\nThe warranty period on all Beyerdynamic products is 2 years. For more warranty details click here.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 880 Edition come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 880 Edition does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nHow is the overall fit?\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 880 Edition comes with an adjustable headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic DT 880 Edition have detachable cables?\n\nNo, it does not have a detachable cable.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic DT 880 Edition good for long usage?\n\nYes, due to it being durable, lightweight and soft earpads make music listening for long hours comfortable.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic DT 880 Edition need an amplifier?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can perform to its full potential.\n\nWhich model is the best? DT 770 Edition, DT 880 Edition or DT 990 Edition?\n\nAll these models are similar in terms of their mechanical and audio quality. The numbers 770, 880, and 990 do not provide any indication of higher or lower quality. All these models do, however, differ significantly in their playback in terms of acoustic design and frequency response.\n\nWhat is the difference between Pro and Edition models of DT 770, DT 880, and DT 990?\n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nIn which way do the different impedances of the DT 880 Edition and DT 990 Edition differ in terms of sound?\n\nThe differences in sound various between impedances are very slight and most people can only actually hear them when the sound is compared directly. They are, in any case, smaller than the differences between any one of these variants and competitor products. In general, it can be stated that the resolution and precision of the high mids and highs are slightly better at higher impedances. There are barely any differences worth mentioning apart from this.\n\nWhat is the technical difference between DT 880/990 edition and DT 880/990 Pro?\n\nThe corresponding variants with the same impedance sound the same. As the same transducer systems are used. The major difference is the edition models have a slightly softer headband for enjoying music at home while the Pro phones have a tighter fit onto the head for everyday work in the studio.\n\nHow can I tell what the impedance of my DT 770/880/990 Edition is?\n\nYou check the impedance of the integrated sound transducers from the connection plug. The impedance is sometimes hot embossed onto the plastic shaft of the plug: If there is nothing there, the model has an impedance of 250 ohms. If it reads 32 Ω, the model has an impedance of 32 ohms. If it reads 600 Ω, the model has an impedance of 600 ohms.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Beyerdynamic DT 880 Edition comes with a 2 year warranty from Beyerdynamic that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Beyerdynamic's warranty in India.\n\n\"The DT 880 has excellent Mid range and an above-average Bass and Treble. Making them sound decently well balanced with instruments and vocals that don't feel pushed back or too forward on most tracks.\"\nRead More\n\n\"The DT880s are very comfortable, with their soft cushion and perfect grip.

  "description": "Designed & Made in Germany\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nFor Studio & Professionals\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nSemi Open-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\n45mm Dynamic Drivers\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSUPERLATIVE AT EVERYTHING: IMPEDANCE, POWER AND SOUND DETAILING\n\nThe robust and dynamic neodymium magnets reproduce the quality sound Beyerdynamic is known for. This increased efficiency also leaves the DT 880 Edition with greater power reserves for precise linear response that is especially suited for high-achieving audio applications where succinct audio reproduction is of paramount importance, and dedicated equipment is available such as a headphone amplifier. The large 250-ohm voice coil provides unparalleled response clarity and increased impulse fidelity. The 250-ohm is the most widely used variant.\n\nSURREAL SOUNDSTAGE EXPERIENCE\n\nSoundstage is that spectrum of music that extends beyond your mind, and creates a sonic illusion of sorts. That is what the DT 880 Edition produces for you, effortlessly. Be it the driver units or the highly intelligible semi-open back design, that is the exact experience the Beyerdynamic DT880 Edition brings home.\n\nINCREASED FIDELITY AND SUPERIOR SONICS\n\nBeyerdynamic comes with the promise of dynamic transducer systems that are placed in their headphones. The over-achieving transducer systems only portray the amount of detailed engineering these headphones can boast of. Increased fidelity and performance is the one obvious feature of these specifically engineered headphones.\n\nSEMI-OPEN BACK DESIGN FORM-FACTOR\n\nThe DT 880 Edition semi-open, over-the-ear design offers slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage, while retaining the high fidelity normally associated with open-back headphones. The semi-open back also lets the headphones breathe which make the sound reproduced seem natural and enhances it to a great extent.\n\nADJUSTABLE HEADBAND, VELOUR EARPADS FOR ADDED COMFORT\n\nMindfully designed, the DT880 Edition comes with an adjustable headband, whose little notch is on the side. Move it to adjust the headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head. The headband created with high-end strap-on leather, will only increase the comfort. The velour earpads are synonymous to bespoke luxury, and speak volumes of the comfort they provide. The build quality of the headphones has also been improved. The single-sided straight cable avoids getting tangled so that your music experience is compromised in no way.\n\nHIGHEST 'HIGHS' IN THE ROOM\n\nOne of the most noticeable features of these headphones is the treble they produce. Rapid and energetic, these over-ear headphones strive to achieve a high standard with higher frequencies, and do so with great elan. The mid range is clear and fine, and bespoke bass, these headphones make you feel closer to music. Solo voices and instruments appear highly defined and close to the listener.\n\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT VARIANT FOR YOU\n\n32Ω - The highly optimised 32 ohms variant is used for regular casual listening over laptops and smartphones. 250Ω - The 250 ohms is a wide choice for a stereo system at home. 600Ω - The 600 ohms is more ideal for hi-fi systems with especially powerful headphone outputs or special headphone amplifiers.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nDynamic Driver\n\nMAGNET\nNeodymium\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ω/250Ω/600Ω\n\nSENSITIVITY\n96 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz - 35,000Hz\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n100 mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nPLUG TYPE\nGold plated stereo jack plug (3.5mm) 1/4\" adapter (6.35mm)\n\nCABLE TYPE\n3m Straight\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n290g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nIn which way do the different impedances of the DT 880 Edition and DT 990 Edition differ in terms of sound?\n\nThe differences in sound various between impedances are very slight and most people can only actually hear them when the sound is compared directly. They are, in any case, smaller than the differences between any one of these variants and competitor products. In general, it can be stated that the resolution and precision of the high mids and highs are slightly better at higher impedances. There are barely any differences worth mentioning apart from this.\n\nWhat is the technical difference between DT 880/990 edition and DT 880/990 Pro?\n\nThe corresponding variants with the same impedance sound the same. As the same transducer systems are used. The major difference is the edition models have a slightly softer headband for enjoying music at home while the Pro phones have a tighter fit onto the head for everyday work in the studio.\n\nHow can I tell what the impedance of my DT 770/880/990 Edition is?\n\nYou check the impedance of the integrated sound transducers from the connection plug. The impedance is sometimes hot embossed onto the plastic shaft of the plug: If there is nothing there, the model has an impedance of 250 ohms. If it reads 32 Ω, the model has an impedance of 32 ohms. If it reads 600 Ω, the model has an impedance of 600 ohms.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Beyerdynamic DT 880 Edition comes with a 2 year warranty from Beyerdynamic that covers manufacturing defects.

  "description": "Designed & Made in Germany\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nFor Studio & Professionals\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nSemi Open-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\n45mm Dynamic Drivers\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSUPERLATIVE AT EVERYTHING: IMPEDANCE, POWER AND SOUND DETAILING\n\nThe robust and dynamic neodymium magnets reproduce the quality sound Beyerdynamic is known for. This increased efficiency also leaves the DT 880 Edition with greater power reserves for precise linear response that is especially suited for high-achieving audio applications where succinct audio reproduction is of paramount importance, and dedicated equipment is available such as a headphone amplifier. The large 250-ohm voice coil provides unparalleled response clarity and increased impulse fidelity. The 250-ohm is the most widely used variant.\n\nSURREAL SOUNDSTAGE EXPERIENCE\n\nSoundstage is that spectrum of music that extends beyond your mind, and creates a sonic illusion of sorts. That is what the DT 880 Edition produces for you, effortlessly. Be it the driver units or the highly intelligible semi-open back design, that is the exact experience the Beyerdynamic DT880 Edition brings home.\n\nINCREASED FIDELITY AND SUPERIOR SONICS\n\nBeyerdynamic comes with the promise of dynamic transducer systems that are placed in their headphones. The over-achieving transducer systems only portray the amount of detailed engineering these headphones can boast of. Increased fidelity and performance is the one obvious feature of these specifically engineered headphones.\n\nSEMI-OPEN BACK DESIGN FORM-FACTOR\n\nThe DT 880 Edition semi-open, over-the-ear design offers slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage, while retaining the high fidelity normally associated with open-back headphones. The semi-open back also lets the headphones breathe which make the sound reproduced seem natural and enhances it to a great extent.\n\nADJUSTABLE HEADBAND, VELOUR EARPADS FOR ADDED COMFORT\n\nMindfully designed, the DT880 Edition comes with an adjustable headband, whose little notch is on the side. Move it to adjust the headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head. The headband created with high-end strap-on leather, will only increase the comfort. The velour earpads are synonymous to bespoke luxury, and speak volumes of the comfort they provide. The build quality of the headphones has also been improved. The single-sided straight cable avoids getting tangled so that your music experience is compromised in no way.\n\nHIGHEST 'HIGHS' IN THE ROOM\n\nOne of the most noticeable features of these headphones is the treble they produce. Rapid and energetic, these over-ear headphones strive to achieve a high standard with higher frequencies, and do so with great elan. The mid range is clear and fine, and bespoke bass, these headphones make you feel closer to music. Solo voices and instruments appear highly defined and close to the listener.\n\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT VARIANT FOR YOU\n\n32Ω - The highly optimised 32 ohms variant is used for regular casual listening over laptops and smartphones. 250Ω - The 250 ohms is a wide choice for a stereo system at home. 600Ω - The 600 ohms is more ideal for hi-fi systems with especially powerful headphone outputs or special headphone amplifiers.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nDynamic Driver\n\nMAGNET\nNeodymium\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ω/250Ω/600Ω\n\nSENSITIVITY\n96 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz - 35,000Hz\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n100 mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nPLUG TYPE\nGold plated stereo jack plug (3.5mm) 1/4\" adapter (6.35mm)\n\nCABLE TYPE\n3m Straight\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n290g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

It features an open-back design with much more detailing as compared to the DT 770 PRO.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a closed-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music even better thanks to its natural noise isolation.\n\nHow is the overall fit?\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 770 Pro fits on the ear so don't go expecting the earcups to envelop your ears in lush comfort.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro have detachable cables?\n\nNo, Unfortunately it does not come with a detachable cable feature.\n\nDo you need an Amplifier for 80 Ohms or 250 Ohms?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can performance to its full potential.\n\nHow do these stack up against Ultrasone Performance 820?\n\nApart from both these headphones being able to be driven easily by your smartphones it is also a choice between a warm and smooth sound against a balanced sound. Read more comparison between the two headphones here\n\nWill the DT 1770 Pro replace the DT 770 Pro?\n\nNo, the DT 1770 Pro is an upgraded version of the DT 770 PRO, made for audio engineers, producers, and musicians who need a pair of high-end studio headphones without compromising on performance in all the aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories. The DT 770 Pro is for beginners who want a reliable, robust, and affordable pair of headphones to work with.\n\nWhat is the difference between Pro and edition models of DT 770, DT 880, and DT 990?\n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nWhich hard case can I buy for my DT 770 Pro?\n\nYou can get the Beyerdynamic - DT Hard Case for your DT 770 Pro.\n\nWhy isn't there a 600-ohms version of the DT 770 Pro models?\n\nIn professional environments most headphone outputs aren't designed for 600-ohms headphones, we only offer headphones with a maximum impedance of 250-ohms.\n\nWhy does my DT 770/990 Pro have another connection cable with a smaller thread?\n\nIn order to be able to plug the headphones with the 3.5 mm jack (unscrewed jack adapter) into a mobile device with a bumper, the M8 thread, which was previously available, was converted to a smaller M5 thread. If your headphones have such an M5 thread you will need an adapter. If you own an M8 threaded jack adapter you can still use it for your headphones, but only as a plug adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 Pro is made for beginners musicians, sound engineers, producers who are looking for a reliable, sturdy, and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 Pro was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nBUYING GUIDE\n\nBest Headphones under 10000 in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty February 27, 2020\nScan through the list with our go-to guide of headphones under Rs. 10000 to find the best one for you.\nRead More\n\nBest Wireless Earphones Under Rs. 10,000\nby Abhijeeth Shetty March 20, 2020\nThe number of wireless in-ears is increasing in the market.

  "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nBest Suited for Portable Use\n\nMetal Build\n\n1 Dynamic + 4 BA Drivers\n\nReplaceable MMCX Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE PERFECT IEM FOR THE TRUE AUDIOPHILE\n\nThe Meze Rai Penta is a high-end audiophile IEM that works effortlessly with any source device due to its low impedance and high sensitivity. It has high-quality sound and the perfect build with its smart, unique and ergonomic housing. This IEM consists of 4 balanced drivers and 1 dynamic driver making it the perfect sonic combination. Enjoy detailed sound, natural tonality and consistent fit.\n\n5 DRIVER CONFIGURATION FOR POWERFUL PERFORMANCE\n\nThe hybrid technology of the Rai Penta delivers harmonized sound frequencies without the overlay of phase issues. The sound has to pass from the housing to the nozzle and finally to the eartips to reach your eardrums. To make this seamless, the precise length of each sound tube has been created to determine the air volume in front of each driver so that the 5 drivers work smoothly and deliver pure sound.\n\nTHE PERFECT DESIGN FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nMost multi-driver configurations use an imperfect plastic tube and dampener system that result in interference. The Rai Penta's driver does away with this design for clean, pure sound. It delivers a balanced sound signature and also provides extreme detailing to every tune, within a frequency range from 4Hz to 45 kHz. Moreover, you can drive it with just about any and every source device.\n\nCNC ALUMINIUM CHASSIS FOR DISTURBANCE-FREE SOUND\n\nThe finely tuned PES design in front and behind the driver assembly helps in controlling the internal chamber pressure by regulating the airflow. For the sound to be directed to your ears without any disturbance, the CNC aluminium chassis is milled from solid aluminium to create a perfect space for it. The milled logo on the high-endurance anodised surface shows the aluminium material under the anodizing.\n\nANATOMICAL, ERGONOMIC DESIGN FOR LONG LISTENING SESSIONS\n\nMeze has designed the Rai Penta's housings to be durable, comfortable and easy to use. The rounded edges are designed to mimic the natural curves of the human ear for a more secure and comfortable fit. It's purely made for the true audiophile to spend hours and hours listening to this beauty.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY CABLES AND CONNECTORS\n\nThese IEMs have been designed with high-purity silver-plated copper wires and use finely crafted metal plugs shells. This ensures that the assembled cables are strong enough for a long time. Each of the 4 wires consists of 20 Litz strands. For the best connectivity and durability, the MMCX plugs are crafted from high-quality materials including a rhodium-plated plug termination.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\nPenta-Hybrid Drivers\n\n4 x Customized Balanced Armature 1 x Dynamic Driver\n\nIMPEDANCE\n20 Ω\n\nSENSITIVITY\n110 dB spl/1mW Sensitivity\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 Hz - 45 kHz\n\nDISTORTION\nless than 1%\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMMCX connector\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nIn-Ear\n\nCABLE\n2.5mm Balanced Cable, 3.5mm connector\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

  "description": "Designed in the USA\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nBest Suited for Portable Use\n\nESS Sabre 9010 DAC Chip\n\n1.2 volts Power Output\n\nPair with Laptop via USB\n\nSuper Lightweight Design\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE ULTIMATE PORTABLE DAC/AMP\n\nThe AudioQuest DragonFly Black has been developed in partnership with Gordon Rankin and Microchip Technologies. It has a better signal to noise ratio and consumes 77% lesser power than the original DragonFly thanks to the Microchip PIC32MX microcontroller. Streamlength™ asynchronous USB code ensures low jitter, low resource load, minimal packet errors, world-class audio playback and reliable connectivity between the Dragonfly Black and any computing device with a USB output.\n\nESS SABRE DAC CHIP & TEXAS INSTRUMENTS TPA6130 FOR GREAT SOUND\n\nThe DragonFly Black comes with a 32-bit 9010 ESS Sabre DAC chip that employs a minimum-phase fast roll-off filter for a naturally detailed, more authentic sound that can process up to 24-bit/96kHz audio. It features a Texas Instruments TPA6130 amp circuit and analogue volume control. You can use the source device's volume controls to adjust the DragonFly Black's volume.\n\nCOMPATIBLE WITH A WIDE RANGE OF HEADPHONE AND SOURCE DEVICES\n\nThis tiny DAC/AMP is compatible with a wide range of headphones, including power-hungry, low-efficiency models. It's compatible with PCs, without needing any additional drivers. You can also use it with your smartphone and enjoy music from your favourite streaming app like Tidal, Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube and more. The DragonFly Black's software can be upgraded with the free Windows or Mac desktop app.\n\nSUPPORTS MQA FOR MASTER-QUALITY SOUND\n\nThe Dragonfly Black supports Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) playback. This is an award-winning audio technology that's meant to deliver the sound of the original master recording. MQA files are tiny and can easily be streamed using Tidal.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nSTATUS/SAMPLE RATES SUPPORTED (LED INDICATOR COLOR CODE)\nStandby (Red), 44.1kHz (Green), 48kHz (Blue), 88.2kHz (Amber), 96kHz (Magenta), MQA (Purple)\n\nVOLUME CONTROL\nAnalog Volume Control\n\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE\n1.2\n\nHEADPHONE AMP\nTexas Instruments TPA6130\n\nDAC CHIP\n32-bit ESS 9010 with minimum-phase fast roll-off filter\n\nMICROCONTROLLER\nMicrochip PIC32MX\n\nDIMENSIONS\n12mm H x 19mm W x 62mm L\n\nSUPPORTED INPUTS\n3.5mm Stereo Jack\n\nHEADPHONE IMPEDANCE\n10 Ohms & Higher\n\nWEIGHT\n22g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Introduce them to a good quality sound from their jack-free smartphone if you can. It won’t break the bank.\" Headfonics\n\n\"The iFi Zen Dac is one of the best entry-level DACs you can buy. It sounds great, has a ton of features, and can grow with your system as your tastes evolve.\" Tech Radar\n\nSEE MORE\nSEE MORE\nSEE MORE\nSEE MORE\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat are the main differences between DragonFlys Black, Red, and Cobalt?\n\nAll DragonFlys are designed to preserve the body, warmth, and natural beauty in music. We like to think of the progression like this: Black is beautiful, Red is more beautiful, and Cobalt is most beautiful. For a complete Model Comparison Chart, Click here.\n\nWill DragonFly make my internal computer speakers sound better?\n\nNo. DragonFly does not use the internal speakers in your computer. DragonFly is specifically designed to connect to external audio devices, such as headphones, powered desktop speakers, complete audio/video systems, and iOS and Android mobile devices. Note: DragonFly v1.0 and DragonFly v1.2 are designed to work with computers and laptops only; they are not designed for use with iOS and Android mobile devices. However, all current-production DragonFly models—Black, Red, and Cobalt—are compatible with iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat kind of audio content can I play through DragonFly?\n\nFrom MP3 to MQA and Hi-Res, DragonFly adds life, meaning, and color to all of your music. With all current-production models of AudioQuest’s DragonFly USB DAC (Black, Red, Cobalt), music appreciation and exploration are limitless: Plug into an Apple or Windows® computer or connect to an iOS® or Android mobile device. Play YouTube or Vimeo videos. Go hunting on Bandcamp or SoundCloud. Explore playlists and podcasts on Spotify, Pandora, or Deezer. Stream high-res audio from Tidal or Qobuz. No matter the choice of sonic pleasure, DragonFly unravels the emotional expression and nuance that makes music and movies so enjoyable.\n\nWhat headphones can I use with the DragonFly?\n\nDragonFly is versatile enough to drive virtually any headphone on the market today, from impedances of 10ohm and higher. While all DragonFly models offer enough output to drive most headphones, DragonFly Black (1.2-volt output) comfortably drives most medium- to moderate-efficiency models and DragonFlys Red and Cobalt (2.1-volt output) easily drive even the lowest-efficiency models.\n\nWhat is an MQA Renderer?\n\nand also matches and compensates the DAC characteristics to the hierarchical target, matching the analog sound heard in the studio. All current-production AudioQuest DragonFlys (Black, Red, and Cobalt) feature an MQA renderer that enables playback of MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the original master recording. When connected to an MQA Core signal (within TIDAL Masters or Audirvana, for example), DragonFly’s purple display indicates the unit is rendering an MQA stream or file.\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Apple device?\n\nAs a fully functional MQA renderer, your DragonFly is ready to unfold and play MQA files through the Tidal music-streaming service. If you have a Tidal Master account and want to enjoy the full benefits of Tidal Master (MQA) files through DragonFly, simply adjust your Tidal playback settings: macOS\nClick on your profile name (located in the top left corner of the Tidal desktop application)\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nUnder “Streaming Audio Quality,” select “Master”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nMake sure that “Passthrough MQA” is not selected\niOS, iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro\nClick “My Collection” (the heart icon; located in the bottom right of the mobile app)\nClick the gear wheel (located in the upper right)\nScroll down and click “Streaming”\nSet WiFi to “Master”\nSet Cellular to your desired option, noting that streaming hi-res with MQA will require a relatively large amount of data\nMake sure “Optimized playback” is enabled\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Windows computer?\n\nTo play MQA files from Tidal on a Windows computer, follow these steps in the Tidal app:\nClick on your profile name\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Android device?\n\nFor Android playback, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro media player by eXtream Software Development.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Windows operating systems?\n\nYes. DragonFly is compatible with Windows 7 and later. If you’re running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, please be sure to install the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (August 9, 2016), to maintain optimal USB audio performance.\n\nWhy can’t I select 88.2kHz as the sample rate in Windows 7?\n\nMicrosoft does not offer native support for 88.2kHz with its Windows 7 operating system. Fortunately, aftermarket programs such as JRiver Media Center and Foobar2000 bypass the Windows “Hardware and Sound” application and allow native 88.2kHz decoding. For more information please visit www.jriver.com or www.foobar2000.org.\n\nAre there known USB-Audio issues with Windows 8 and Windows RT?\n\nEarly versions of Windows 8 had compatibility issues with their device drivers and many USB DACs (including DragonFly). If you are running Windows 8, we suggest that you do the following:\nMake sure your OS has all of the latest updates and service packs installed.\nOnce all OS updates have been installed, check that all hardware device drivers are up to date and compatible with the latest version of Windows 8.\n\nThere are no reported audio issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nThe AQ Device Manager is not detecting my DragonFly. What should I do?\n\nIf the installation is complete and the DragonFly is not visible, you may need to restart your computer to complete the installation process.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Mac OS X?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt are compatible with OS X (starting with OS 10.6.8 to present). There are no known compatibility issues with OS X.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Apple iOS devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black and Red can be used with Apple iOS devices. Yes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt can be used with Apple iOS devices. An Apple Camera Adapter is required to connect DragonFly to an Apple Lightning device. In our tests, Apple's Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter (with charging port) sounds better and is more reliable than Apple’s less expensive Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, while also providing the ability to charge during playback. Your mileage may vary. Some users prefer the size of the smaller adapter, while others prefer the performance of the larger adapter. We encourage experimentation. When DragonFly (Black, Red, Cobalt) is connected to an iOS device using Apple’s older Lightning to USB Camera Connection Kit, I can hear clicks and pops in the background of the music. What should I do? In some rare instances, the combination of an iOS device in conjunction with the standard CCK and DragonFly Black, Red, or Cobalt causes a clicking in the background of the music. Neither we nor Apple have been able to determine why this is, but, in circumstances where this occurs, we’ve found that using Apple’s Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter resolves the problem. In addition, this connector offers improved audio performance over the smaller unit and provides the ability to charge the attached iOS device while listening to music.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Android devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt will work with most Android devices running on Lollipop OS (and some Android devices running on KitKat), provided that the device manufacturer has adhered to the USB specification and implementation, and supports audio over USB. To verify that your Android device complies with isochronous USB audio, download and run USB Host Check. In our early pre-production testing, we found that some Android devices (4.1 OS and newer) do not provide native support for audio over USB. If you find that your Android device (4.1 or newer) does not support audio over USB, we ask that you please contact the manufacturer of your device. To determine whether your device supports audio over USB, consult the user manual or visit the manufacturer’s website. Despite Android’s support of USB audio output, there are still hardware manufacturers that do not completely adhere to the USB audio class specification. If you experience this, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro application. UAPP includes its own USB audio device driver that is compliant with the USB Organization’s USB Audio Host Mode Class specification. Further, it is compatible with various audio formats and will manage music on both the Android’s internal memory and inserted SD cards. With the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network, this application can also find and connect to DLNA servers/libraries. USB Audio Player PRO Version 5 now supports audio from Google Music, Tidal (including Tidal Masters), Qobuz, and Shoutcast, and includes an MQA Core Decoder, which will unfold MQA streams from 44.1/48kHz to 88.2/96 kHz and can be combined with DragonFly for further unfolding of even higher sample rates.\n\nHow do I set volume level when using DragonFly?\n\nWhen using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, start at a low (or zero) volume level, then slowly raise the volume until the desired level is achieved. When using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, it functions in variable output mode, and we recommend the following steps:\nSet the volume control of the associated music player application to maximum.\nSet the computer’s main (operating system) volume control to 25% of maximum.\nUsing the computer’s main (operating system) volume control, adjust the volume to the desired level.\n\nDragonFly Black is equipped with a 64-step analog volume control. With DragonFly Black connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly Black’s onboard volume. This ensures maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nIn DragonFly Red and Cobalt, we were able to employ a highly sophisticated 64-step, 64-bit, bit-perfect digital volume control. It works similarly: With DragonFly Red/Cobalt connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly’s onboard volume. Here again, we’ve optimized the volume control to ensure maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nYou can also use DragonFly as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD player, DVD player, or Blu-ray player), connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. When used in this manner, DragonFly functions in fixed output mode, which allows the overall volume level to be adjusted with the audio/video system’s master volume control. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the computer’s main (operating system) volume level should be set to maximum.\n\nDragonFly can play audio data at four different sample rates. Which one should I choose?\n\nDragonFly will play music or audio data at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. For the best sound quality, the computer should be configured so that it sends music and audio data to DragonFly that matches the native rate of the music. For example, since all CDs use a sample rate of 44.1kHz, 44.1kHz tends to be the “native rate” of most digital music. In most cases, for most people, this will be the best sample rate to choose. Choosing a sample rate that is higher than the native rate of a music file will convert the audio data using mathematical approximations that can potentially decrease the sound quality. Conversely, if you have high-resolution music files, configuring your computer for 44.1kHz (or any other lower sample rate) will cause the computer to down-sample your music to a lower resolution. When possible, always configure the computer to output the native sample rate of the music you are listening to. Many music player software suites on the market manage this process for you.\n\nWhat do the various colors of DragonFly’s LED indicate?\n\nDragonFly’s LED displays different colors to indicate status or sample rate of audio data. For DragonFlys Black and Red: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Amber = 88.2kHz; Magenta = 96kHz; Purple = MQA. For DragonFly Cobalt: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Yellow = 88.2kHz; Light Blue = 96kHz; Purple = MQA.\n\nI purchased high-resolution music files at 24-bit/176.4kHz or 24-bit/192kHz. Can I play these files using my DragonFly? Yes. However, as mentioned above, DragonFly performs best when audio data is processed at its native sample rate.\n\nIf you have higher resolution files, it is important to choose the correct higher sample rate in order to maximize the benefit of those files. For the best performance with sampling rates above DragonFly’s 96kHz ceiling, files should be played at a rate mathematically related to their native resolution. For instance, a 192kHz file should be played at 96kHz (i.e., 2 x 96000.0 = 192000.0). By selecting sample rates that are directly divisible, the computer avoids having to do sonically degrading, complex math in its conversions, and allows DragonFly to sound its best.\n\nWhat music player applications does AudioQuest recommend?\n\nWhile iTunes was once the easy and obvious answer, a cottage industry of higher-performance, add-on applications have since sprouted up. These applications address OS X only.\nAmarra\nAudirvana Plus\nBit Perfect\nPure Music\n\nStand-alone media players (for Apple and Windows)\n\nJRiver is a complete audio and video media player, offering both USB and Network (airplay and DLNA) connectivity.\nRoon works seamlessly with a local media collection and Tidal Streaming services. Additionally, Roon enables streaming to multiple locations, and a complementary iPad application enables an external interface.\nTidal is a subscription-based, CD-quality (1411kbps) streaming service. It offers both music and high-definition video content, including full-length concerts\nQobuz is a subscription-based streaming service that offers an outstanding selection of hi-resolution content.\n\nFor any technical support or questions regarding the functionality or use of these recommended playback applications, please contact the manufacturer. AudioQuest cannot provide technical support for any of these recommended playback applications.\n\nIs DragonFly a FCC-compliant digital device?\n\nDragonFly has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy, and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\nReorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\nIncrease the separation between the equipment and receiver.\nConnect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that of the receiver.\nConsult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician.\n\nModifications not expressly approved by the manufacturer could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment under FCC rules.\n\nIs it better to leave DragonFly constantly plugged in, or should I unplug it when it’s not in use?\n\nIt is completely safe to leave DragonFly plugged in at all times. We hope that you will always want it connected to your music playback device! While repeatedly plugging and unplugging DragonFly will not affect its lifespan or reliability, in general we have found that DACs measure and sound better after being left on for at least 24 hours.\n\nDo you recommend using JitterBug with DragonFly?\n\nWe absolutely recommend using JitterBug with DragonFlys Black and Red, both in series (with DragonFly plugged directly into JitterBug) and/or in parallel (with JitterBug plugged into a separate USB port within the host computer). However, because some of JitterBug’s filtering is included in DragonFly Cobalt, a JitterBug is not necessary and not recommended with mobile devices or when only one USB port is available. When using Cobalt, you can still optimize the digital audio from a computer, car stereo, or other hardware by adding a JitterBug (in parallel only) into a different USB port.\n\nDOWNLOADS\nFlight Manual DragonFly Black\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this AudioQuest DragonFly Black comes with a 1 year warranty from AudioQuest that covers manufacturing defects.

  "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nSILENCE IS GOLDEN, NOISE IS NOT\n\nAn increase in the number of power outlets, plugs and other electronic devices in your set-up can cause clashes among the signals they emit. This causes interferences, hiss and distortion. The iFi Audio DC iPurifier2’s Active Noise Cancellation2® (ANC2) technology creates an exactly identical but opposite signal to that of the noise signal and cancels it out.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY COMPONENTS & THE BEST TECHNOLOGY FOR A GREAT AUDIO EXPERIENCE\n\nThe DC iPurifier2 uses only the best of technology and components to give you a great experience. Along with Active Noise Cancellation2, the Panasonic SP-Cap Polymer Aluminium Capacitors greatly reduce the noise while keeping your device at a stable temperature. Premium components like high-precision MELF resistors and custom operational amps with copper-alloy shielding make this a high-quality product.\n\nCLEANS THE NOISE OF ANY DEVICE\n\nEnjoy a noise reduction for 5v -24v SMPS. Simply add your DC iPurifier2 in between the SMPS and the device whose noise you would like to clean and you are good to go. The noise will be reduced by a factor of 316x to 100,000x. It works with any DAC or desktop workstation.\n\nWORKS WITH ALL KINDS OF POWER SOURCES\n\nThe DC iPurifier2 is compatible with all kinds of power sources. It works with 5 x 1.35mm, 5 x 2.1mm and 5 x 2.5mm which makes it work seamlessly with any kind of DC barrel connector. It will bring out the definition, detail and warmth in your music.\n\nCLEANS NOISE ACROSS THE FREQUENCY RANGE\n\nA ground-up, ultra-wideband design cleans up noise from 1Hz to 5GHz with the best performance in between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. The DC iPurifier2 also protects your device by giving you a warning if the input polarity is reversed.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nVOLT COMPATIBILITY\nCompatible with 5-24 volt DC power supply units (up to 3.5A, 84W)\n\nCONSTRUCTION\niFi ‘FINAL’ aircraft-grade RFI shielded aluminium chassis\n\n3 DC BARREL VERSION\n5.5×2.1mm (adapters for 5.5×2.5mm and 3.5×1.35mm included)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. iFi Audio - DC iPurifier 2\n\nDOWNLOADS\nTech Notes\nUser Manual\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this iFi Audio DC iPurifier 2 comes with a 1 year warranty from iFi Audio that covers manufacturing defects.

It can add juice to just about any source device. The metallic design and smooth contours make it look stylish. An 18-hour battery life lets you use it for long. When the battery goes down, simply charge it back with the USB Type-C cable.\n\nCONNECT SEAMLESSLY WITH THE LATEST BLUETOOTH CODECS\n\nConnect up to 8 devices wirelessly with Bluetooth and stream high-quality audio from your favourite streaming apps like Apple Music, Tidal, Spotify and iTunes. Qualcomm aptX and AAC lets you enjoy CD-quality audio.\n\nBALANCED IS THE WAY OF LIFE\n\nNo matter the impedance, the xCAN is able to amplify headphones up to 600Ω with the dual-mono headphone amplifier. It features 1000mW power per channel. A balanced in/out as well as 2.5mm balanced headphone jack lets you connect to a variety of sources as well as any headphone/ earphone.\n\nGET A BALANCED PERFORMANCE WITH SINGLE-ENDED CONNECTIONS USING S-BALANCED\n\nThe exclusive S-Balanced (single-ended compatible balanced) technology gives you great performance with reduced crosstalk and low distortion. With balanced wiring and the special 3.5mm output, you can get the benefits of a balanced connection even when using a single-ended headphone.\n\nXBASSII® & 3D+® TO ADD MAGIC TO YOUR MUSIC\n\nMusic has never been more enjoyable with iFi’s new cool innovations. The XBassⅡ® is an analogue bass correction system which corrects the headphone’s bass response and delivers a more natural sound to the mid frequencies. The 3D+® system adds a 3-dimensional feel to your music giving you the feeling that the artist is performing right in front of you.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY CIRCUIT SYSTEM FOR MORE POWER & LESS JITTERS\n\nThe Cyberdrive headphone amplifier stage is a new and important circuit design used only in iFi’s ‘x-series’. This circuit lets you digitally control the analogue system. A W990VST digitally controlled stepped attenuator and OV4627 ultra-low noise FET input Op-Amp give you an awesome sound quality. The built-in Global Master Timing from AMR is a systematic digital solution that solves the digital jitter problem once and for all.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nINPUTS\nWireless: ESS Sabre 44.1/48k 16-Bit (AAC, aptX, aptX LL and SBC) Wired: 3.5mm (TRS or TRRS S-Balanced*) and 2.5mm (TRRS) *ONLY found in iFi components such as nDSD BL.

The FPGA-based WTA (Watts Transient Alignment) filtering technology is very effective in improving the sound quality. This upscaler can upgrade standard audio at 44.1kHz up to 705.6kHz i.e. 16 times that of a CD’s 44.1kHz native resolution.\n\nUPSCALE YOUR DAC'S PERFORMANCE WITH MULTIPLE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS\n\nWhile optimised to be used with select Chord Electronics DACs, the Hugo M Scaler can work with other DACs as well. You can extend the 96kHz performance of the Qutest, Dave or Hugo TT2 to 768kHz with the dual BNC sockets. Other outputs include single BNC at 352.8/384kHz and optical S/PDIF at 176.4/192kHz. You can also connect to a variety of digital sources with the two BNC sockets, two Toslink sockets and a Type-B USB input.\n\nDESIGNED TO BE COMPACT & EASY TO USE\n\nThe Hugo M Scaler has been made to align with the rest of the TT (Table Top) series so that it’s really easy to stack up. It features illuminable fascia-mounted spherical controls where the data (on the input source and incoming sample rate) is visually displayed on a polychromatic scale. It also has a governing input selection, output sample rate and video mode for lower latency.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFPGA\nXilinx XC7A200T\n\nFILTER TAP LENGTH\n1,015,808 WTA taps\n\nTAP LENGTH FILTERS\n1,015,808 (16FS filter)\n\nINPUTS\n1x Galvanically isolated Type-B USB, 2x Coax BNC and 2x Optical\n\nOUTPUTS\n1x Galvanically isolated dual BNC (enables upscaling to the maximum 768kHz), 1x BNC S/PDIF and 1x Optical\n\nPCM SUPPORT\n44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz, 192kHz, 352.8kHz, 384kHz, 717.6kHz, and 768kHz. 16 – 32bit\n\nDRIVE SUPPORT\nDriverless with Mac OS X and Linux, driver required for Windows OS\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nThe most advanced digital filter in the world Adjustable sample rate output (with pass-thru mode) Video mode (for lower latency) Auto video and source selection ‘DX’ controls for a future product design\n\nDIMENSIONS\n4cm (H) 23.5cm (W) 23.8cm (D)\n\nWEIGHT\n2.55 kg\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

  "title": "Meze - Empyrean",
  "id": "1554717769791",
  "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Meze’s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mm² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils — Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An Isomagnetic® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Ω\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANAR®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

  "description": "Designed in Romania\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nMetal Build\n\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Drivers\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTHE FLAGSHIP THAT'S MADE FROM PASSION\n\nThe Empyrean is the result of two passionate companies coming together to give you an audiophile-level headphone. The powerful drivers are made by Rinaro, an audio company that has been at the forefront in the development of planar magnets since the 1980s. The drivers have been hand-assembled and tested in the Rinaro industrial facility in Ukraine. The rest of the headphone has been crafted using Meze’s gorgeous aesthetics and user-centric design.\n\nULTRALIGHT, HIGH-QUALITY NEODYMIUM MAGNETS\n\nNeodymium magnets are placed on either side of the ultralight diaphragm (Weighing only 0.16 g while having a 4650 mm² of active area). These magnets are placed in a hybrid array which creates an efficient Isodynamic magnetic field. This ensures uniform activation across the whole diaphragm surface.\n\nCOMFORTABLE AND GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT\n\nTo reduce the amount of pressure on your head, the Empyrean features patented suspension wings which increase the contact of the leather headband with your head. The remaining skeleton of the headphone is made of light and durable carbon fibre as well as aluminum. The chassis is sculpted from one solid piece of aluminium to look gorgeous as well as control the airflow between the chassis and driver. This gives you natural transparency in the sound.\n\nDRIVERS THAT ARE MEANT TO MATCH YOUR EAR\n\nIn order to create a powerful driver while keeping the weight at a minimum, Meze has created the drivers in ovoid shape, based on the anatomy of the human ear. The Empyrean uses a unique processing method that creates an ultralight yet rigid diaphragm. A custom-developed isotropic thermally stabilized polymer is used along with a conductive layer which is then enclosed in a fibre-glass infused ABS casing.\n\nA UNIQUE COMBINATION FOR BETTER IMAGING\n\nThe power output has been increased by using the magnet array design as well as two coils — Switchback and Spiral. This unique combination generates an increased exposure of direct sound wave frequencies over the 110kHz range and improves imaging and localization by reducing the impact of shortwave time delays caused by diffused field reflections.\n\nSWITCHBACK & SPIRAL VOICE COILS FOR DETAILED SOUND\n\nThe Switchback coil is placed on the upper part of the driver and reproduces the lower frequencies effectively while the Spiral coil is positioned on the driver directly over the ear canal and effectively avoids time delays by allowing the sound waves to directly enter into the ear. It effectively reproduces the mid and high frequencies at their best.\n\nKEEPS MAGNETIC FIELDS AWAY FROM YOU\n\nAll drivers create a magnetic field. The Empyrean has special ferromagnetic ear pads that reduce the magnetic field while the ferromagnetic plates channel 12% of the magnetic field back into the driver improving its efficiency. It deflects an additional 95% of stray fields away from the head. An Isomagnetic® ear cup uses this magnetic field to hold the earcups in place.\n\nSPECS\n\nEMPYREAN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nRinaro Isodynamic Hybrid Array\n\nSENSITIVITY\n130 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 - 110,000 Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n31,6 Ω\n\nNOMINAL SPL\n100 dB (1 mW / 1 kHz)\n\nMAXIMUM SPL\n130 dB\n\nTHD\n130 dB\n\nMZ3 DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n102 mm x 73 mm\n\nDRIVER WEIGHT\n82 g\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPE\nRinaro ISOPLANAR®\n\nACTIVE AREA\n4650 mm2\n\nDIAPHRAGM WEIGHT\n0.16 g\n\nACOUSTIC MASS\n10.7 kg/m4\n\nLOWER FREQUENCY LIMIT\n4 Hz\n\nUPPER-FREQUENCY LIMIT\n110.000 Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nIsodynamic\n\nMAGNET SIZE\n75 mm x 49 mm\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n0.35 T\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n430g\n\nGRILL\nOpen Back\n\nGEOMETRICAL SHAPE\nOvoid\n\nCASING\nFiberglass Infused ABS\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

  "id": "1480887173183",
  "description": "Designed in Japan\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nElectrostatic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nTangle-Free Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nYOUR VERY OWN CONCERT HALL, SOUNDS FOLD & CRAFTED TO PERFECTION\n\nThe SR-009S uses a diaphragm which consists of an ultra-thin plastic film. This film has a mass that’s close to zero and offers a high transient characteristic throughout the entire audio spectrum. The STAX SR-009S uses an evolved version of the Multilayer fixed electrode MLER (Multi-Layer-Elect-Rords) used in the SR-009. The edge of the electrode opening has been smoothened to reduce air resistance and improve sound permeability. To avoid resonance and the muddying of sound by such a thin electrode, it has been gold-plated with high specific gravity. This also gives you high speed, clarity, silky details and powerful texture. The guard mesh on the outer part of the headphone has been curved to increase sound intensity, improve resolution and lower the influence of sound reflection. The arc-shaped headband has a 10-step slider making it easier to adjust it to just about any head size.\n\nHIGH PURITY, NOTHING ELSE, LIGHTWEIGHT BUT DURABLE & SUPERIOR COMFORT\n\nThe cables used in the SR-009S are similar to those used in the wiring of large-scale integration circuits or high-end audio cables. The copper wire has a purity of 99.9999% (6Nines). This is further silver-coated and finished for a better structure. Just about every part of the SR-009S is made of precise machine processed aluminium. This ensures that it is lightweight as well as durable. The thickness of the case has been reduced as much as possible to make the flow of condensation-and-rarefaction airwave from the sound element more smooth and to reduce resonance. The SR-009S has been crafted by experts. The soft earpads are made using the perfect blend of genuine lambskin leather and high-quality synthetic leather. This avoids sweaty ears and ensures long and comfortable listening sessions.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5 - 42,000Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n145k Ω (Including Cable, At 10kHz)\n\nSOUND PRESSURE SENSITIVITY\n101dB / 100V R.m.s. 1 KHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nMAXIMUM SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL\n118dB / 400Hz\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nTYPE\nPush-Pull Open Back Circular Electrostatic Headphone\n\nELECTROSTATIC CAPACITANCE\n110pF (Including Cable)\n\nLEFT & RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION \"L\" And \"R\" Indicated On The Arc Assembly (Inside Head Spring) Left Channel Cable Is Marked With A Solid Line.

  "description": "Designed in Germany\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nClosed-Back Design\n\nDynamic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOPEN TO YOUR EARS, CLOSED TO YOUR EYES\n\nExperience every nuance in your music with the HD 800 successor, Sennheiser HD 820. It gives you reference-quality audio that is very spacious thanks to the custom engineering drivers from Sennheiser. Every note sounds vivid and life-like, just the way the sound engineer intended it to be. The Sennheiser HD 820s sport a closed, circum-aural dynamic stereo headphone design that makes you feel directly connected to the music. Music emerges from silence and sounds so profound that would travel into a soundstage of amazement.\n\nOPEN SOUND IN A CLOSED FORM FACTOR\n\nMost audiophiles feel that music can truly be enjoyed only with the wide spaciousness of an open-back headphone. But, the Sennheiser HD 820 is here to change that with its special Ring Radiator transducers and unique glass covers. These covers are concave in shape and reflect the sound waves from the drivers to an absorber, thus giving you a similar open sound. Soundstage refers to being able to sense the spatial surroundings of a recording.\n\nINGENIOUS KEVLAR-REINFORCED CABLES FOR MINIMAL LOSS\n\nEach and every part of the HD 820 has been crafted by experts to give you the best performance. The impedance-matching cable is specially tuned and symmetrical to reduce capacitance. It has silver-wrapped OFC wires and ends with a balanced 4.4mm gold-plated jack. This offers superior contact resistance.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CIRCUMAURAL DESIGN WITH ALCANTARA EARCUPS\n\nThe Japanese Alcantra Earcups boast of suede-like fabric material that you’ll find used for the interior of many high end automobiles and racecars. It definitely feels like an airy version of suede, as it doesn't have the heft of most leather materials. Also the fabric breathes, which is great for long listening sessions when you don’t want to have to air out your ears. Handcrafted ear pads made of high-quality microfiber fabric and the ear cups are covered with a thin metallic mesh.\n\nCRAFTED WITH THE BEST, FOR THE BEST\n\nOnly high-quality materials are used to make this headphone. This includes the comfortable handcrafted earpads as well as the robust metal headband. The HD 820 also looks great with its glass covers that let you view the inside components of the headphone.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nTRANSDUCER PRINCIPLE\ndynamic, closed\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nDynamic\n\nIMPEDANCE\n300 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103 dB at 1 kHz, 1V\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n12 - 43800 Hz (-3 dB) 6 - 48000 Hz (-10 dB)\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n6.35 mm / 4.4 mm XLR-4 (optional)\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\naround the ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n3m\n\nWEIGHT\n360 g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

The double-sided Neodymium magnet arrays deliver a uniform driving force across the entire diaphragm for a near-zero distortion.\n\nPROPRIETARY LOTUS DIAPHRAGM FOR A SMOOTH SOUND\n\nAudeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm has a printed circuit across most of its surface and is capable of handling maximum continuous operating temperatures of over 400° F. This gives the drivers a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and an extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room.

Simply insert your iFi Audio AC iPurifier into the mains wall outlet that supplies your audio system or the mains extension block of the system and listen to only pure music. It effectively filters out the noise created by your power supply as well as interference from other devices.\n\nSILENCE IS GOLDEN, NOISE IS NOTACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION2 FOR NOISE-FREE, CLEAR SOUND\n\nThe AC iPurifier generates a signal that is identical to the noise signal but in the opposite phase. While passive purifiers tend to filter only higher frequencies, the AC iPurifier’s Active Noise Cancellation® (ANC) filtration system effectively cancels out all noise signals across a wide range of frequencies.\n\nPROTECTS YOUR EQUIPMENT FROM POWER SURGES & GROUND LOOPS\n\nThe AC iPurifier provides for an intelligent ground connection if your system needs it while taking care that no ground loop is created in the process. Simple LEDs tell you if the polarity is correct on inserting it into your system. It will automatically cut-off power if it detects an abnormal surge in electricity and protect your equipment.\n\nINSPIRED BY THE FRENCH MILITARY\n\nThis iPurifier is meant to last for long. It has an aircraft-grade shielded aluminium chassis that is super-durable and can last for a long time. This purifier draws inspiration from French military engineering and can handle power streams from 5 volts to 24 volts.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nNOISE REDUCTION\n40dB (> 100x)\n\nSURGE PROTECTION\nMaximum: 30,000 A @ 1000 V / 10 μs\n\nOPERATING VOLTAGE\n90 to 265 VAC\n\nSIZE/WEIGHT (USA)\nø 40mm x 105mm (L)/ 108 (g) / 0.24 (lbs)\n\nSIZE/WEIGHT (EU)\nø 40mm x 115mm (L)/ 126 (g) / 0.28 (lbs)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. iFi Audio - AC iPurifier (White Adapter/EU configuration)\n\nDOWNLOADS\nUser Manual\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this iFi Audio AC iPurifier comes with a 1 year warranty from iFi Audio that covers manufacturing defects.

  "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nHIGH-QUALITY MATERIALS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Mercury 3.0 has been crafted by expert engineers who have used only high-quality materials. It uses heavy OFHC continuous copper silver matrix conductors that have end-to-end shielding for the cable. The Final USB connectors have been machined from aircraft-grade aluminium and used gold-plated connections for extra durability.\n\nNOT YOUR AVERAGE USB CABLE\n\nUnlike common USB cables that come with barely any shielding, the Mercury 3.0 has a quadruple shielding that entirely separates and protects the USB signal from any power interference. This reduces EMI and RFI cable noise and gives you the cleanest audio you can possibly get.\n\nSHHH... ONLY PURE SOUND\n\nThe Mercury 3.0 has 3 custom-made metal oxide ceramic RF noise silencers. Since each filter has a different effective range, the RF noise is silenced over a wider range. While 2 silencers are fixed at opposite ends of the range, the middle one is adjustable and can be moved along the entire length of the cable. This detunes the antennae formed by the cable and further reduces noise.\n\nFASTER, SMOOTHER, HIGHER STANDARDS\n\nEnjoy a faster and smoother audio experience with the Mercury 3.0. This USB cable is crafted with high-quality cables and connectors. This ensures a higher standard transmission platform and a less jittery audio & power transfer.
